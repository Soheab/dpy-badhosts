**this list is not exhaustive**

Reason not listed or considering buying but not sure if it's any "good"? Ask around in the server.

Trusted hosts can be found at `?tag hosting` in the server.

# Anything missing?
A host, grammer mistakes, reason, etc? PR it! That's why this is a public repository instead of a gist or hardcoded in the tag.
